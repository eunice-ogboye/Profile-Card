        My goal is to deepen my understanding of advanced development concepts, refine my collaboration skills,

      <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
      <p>
        I sometimes feel less confident in complex backend optimization and large-scale system architecture. 
        However, I am actively learning and building confidence by working on more Node.js and cloud-based projects 
        to strengthen these areas.

      <h2>Note to My Future Self</h2>
      <p>
        Dear future me, remember how far you’ve come — every line of code written, every challenge faced, 
        every lesson learned. Keep the fire alive, stay curious, and never lose the passion that drives your purpose.

      <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        Growth is not always loud; sometimes, it’s found in small victories and quiet persistence. 
        I’m learning to appreciate every step in this journey — both the successes and the struggles — 
        as essential parts of becoming the developer and person I aspire to be.
